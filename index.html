    <h1>Alan Walker</h1>
    <h2>Diamond Heart</h2>
        <p>If I had a diamond heart
            oh oh
            I’d give you all my love
            If I was unbreakable

            If I had a diamond heart
            oh oh
            You could shoot me with a gun of gold
            If I was unbreakable

            I’d walk straight through the bullet
            bendin’ like a tulip
            blue-eyed and foolish
            never mind the bruises
            into the fire
            breakin’ through the wires
            give you all I’ve got
        </p>
